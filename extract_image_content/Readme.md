## Extract specific content from an image

This code shows how we can extract specific contents from a given image using OpenCV.

As an example, I have taken an image of a brain scan report and the goal is to extract the 4 specific brain scans from this image.

Further applications may include training a machine learning model using a dataset of such extracted scans to help diagnose specific medical conditions.
