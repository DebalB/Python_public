## Extracting Objects of Interest from images using OpenCV

This code demonstrates how to detect and extract objects of interest from images using OpenCV.

For this demo, I have taken an example problem of detecting balls and edges from images of pool table.

Final goal is to identify and mark the locations of all 4 table inner edges and all balls on the table.

For a detailed explanation, refer to the [blog post](https://medium.com/object-extraction-from-images-using-opencv-python/extracting-circles-and-long-edges-from-images-using-opencv-and-python-236218f0fee4).

### Usage:

> python pool_table_detection_final_v2.py --image images/image4.png

### Sample Result
![Result1](imahges/image3_processed.png "result1")
