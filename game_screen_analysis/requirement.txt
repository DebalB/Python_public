Hi
hi
Q
Do you do imagine identifying bot
i am not sure I understand fully
can you please clarify with an example?
A bot can identify this imagine
Q
Let me auto buy this item
give me some time, i will get back to you
Q
Ok ty
Ok, I am back
Q
Csn be done?
So from the video I could see that some game items need to be identified and bought
Yes
Q
And price
The exact item need to be identified given a sample image of same
Identification of the items is not a problem
How about price
Q
Of item
But interface with the game is a problem
Price of the items can also be identified
Q
I will be running on emulator
By recognizing text
Q
Not exact price
How does the emulator work
But if anything below price can?
Q
Android amulator
So it will run on a laptop/desktop
Q
Yes
Ok. But it still needs to interface
Q
Can be done?
I am not sure how
I can implement some parts of it
Q
Will take how much to deliver
But the whole implementation would need more components and APIs
Cost can be anywhere around 500 usd
Sure
Q
How long to deliver
It may take 3-4 weeks
Ok
Q
You need to run some test first?
Yes sure
I would need sample images
And I may have some questions
Which I will need you to clarify
Q
Yeahs sure what questions
Once I get the samples I will list out my queries
Mostly to determine the scope of work
This is ok?
Q
Both color
yes images are good
now can you share me a sample from the game screen which shows these images
or maybe I can use the video you already sent
Q
Like this
yes
so the first task i will attempt will be to match the gun images in the game screenshot
if a match is found i will try and extract the price mentioned against the gun
Not gun just the background color
Q
Yellow
oh ok
if a match is found i will try and extract the price mentioned against the gun yes
If I put
Below
1billion
Q
Anything below this price will be purchase
ok, understood
https://youtu.be/bfusOgH0hdI
This in Chinese
Q
You watch
ok
Roughly the idea I want
Q
Just that my bot need to identify imagine
you mentioned to match only background color
Q
Yes
but how about two guns with same background color
like MAG ATK 1199 and 1112
If both below 1b
Q
Purchase both
ok
only condition is that the background color of the gun should be yellow?
Yes
So this another item
Match yellow
Q
Buy
ok
you do not want any guns with any other color background?
So the bot will auto scan the market for this imagine and buy
Any item with yellow background
Q
Not just guns
oh ok
understood
Q
Yellow green and red possible?
yes
as many as you want
As you see they few job classes
Warrior archer
And under 1 drop down
Got the items
And select the rank unique item
Q
For yellow
can you share some samples from other colors too
Q
the colors that you want to identify
Q
Green
any other color? red?
Q
Red
thanks
How about the scanning speed of the imagine
Q
Can be adjust?
that i am not sure
But definitely can auto scan
Q
https://youtu.be/bfusOgH0hdI
will try out a few tests and share my results
Q
You see video for some example
yes I will check it out
the part which I do not know is how to control the game to perform auto scan
like how to click on different levels on the right
and how to navigate the game menu etc
for me that is the difficult part
Q
You think download game will help?
is it an online game?
Q
Yes
played in browser?
Android and apple game
But I will run on android emulator
Q
Which is on my desktop
i am not sure if downloading the game will help
the game needs to provide certain APIs and controls to the script
which can be used to navigate th e game menu etc
this part is not clear to me
For this doesn't require hacking or anything right
Q
I don't have source code for this game
i dont know exactly
if there was any means to get the screenshots as images while the game is being played
i could scan the images and extract the necessary info
Q
Ok how long you need test this
i can tell you tomorrow i think
Q
Ok ty
thanks
